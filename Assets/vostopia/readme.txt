Vostopia Avatar Api - Avatars as a Service
==========================================

The vostopia avatar system gives you a super quick and painless way of getting customisable avatars in 
your game. 

Getting Started
---------------

Get started with vostopia avatars in just a few minutes by following the steps below

Get a GameId and Api Key on https://vostopia.com/developer/games/

	In order to let users use their avatars in your game, you have to sign up for a vostopia
	account and set up a game. This will give you a Game Id, and an Api Key. Don't give your api
	key to anyone else, as that will allow them to use the vostopia api service on your behalf!

Set up GameId and Api Key in Editor

	Armed with your Game Id and Api Key, open the "Vostopia Settings" window in the Unity Editor. 
	You can find it on the Window toolbar.

	Enter your Game Id and Api Key, and you're good to go.

Start Example

	Now you open the example scene in Assets/vostopia/examples/Animation/AnimationExample.unity
	and hit play, which should bring up an authentication screen followed by loading your avatar.
