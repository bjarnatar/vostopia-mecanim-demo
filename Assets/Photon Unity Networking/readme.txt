	Menu -> Windows, Photon Unity Networking


Importing into your project
	To import this package into your project, skip the folders "Demo Worker" and "MarcoPolo-Tutorial".
	You can also delete them after import. 
	Everything important is in the folders "Plugins" and "Editor".


Server
	Exit Games Photon can be run on your servers or you can subscribe to our cloud service.
	
	The window "Photon Unity Networking" will help you setup a Photon Cloud account.
	This service is geared towards room-based games and the server cannot be modified.
	Read more about it: http://www.exitgamescloud.com

	Alternatively, you can download the server SDK and run your own Photon server.
	The SDK comes with a complete game logic (ready to run, like in Photon Cloud)
	but you also get the source code for the game logic to modify and extend it.
	A 100 concurrent user license is free (also for commercial use) per game.
